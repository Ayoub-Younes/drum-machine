# Drum Machine

This is a Drum Machine project created as part of my JavaScript Libraries certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project allows users to play drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keyboard keys.

## Project Overview

The Drum Machine lets users interact with a set of drum pads, either by clicking on them or using keyboard keys. When a pad is triggered, the corresponding sound is played, and the display updates to show the name of the sound. Users can also control the volume using a slider. The layout is responsive and designed for simplicity, with a clean interface and easy-to-use controls.
